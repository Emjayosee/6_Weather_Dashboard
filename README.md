# Unit 06 Javascript Homework: Weather Cards

Submitted: February --, 2021, Michael O'Connor, WebDev Wannabe, 604 765-6061

# 01 Goal: The goal is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.Here is a link to the Github folder https://github.com/Emjayosee/Assignment06 and a link to the deployed website https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment06/.

# 02 Approach:

    In approching this project, started by getting an API key from the recommended weather platform.   Here is a link to the deployed page - https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment04/.

    I followed the following plan design:

        Weather Map

            Goal: To Build a weather dashboard

            TBD.

            Design:
            •	Main page with a weather dashboard;
            •	Need to have a search capability to look for specific cities;
            •	Needs to display a five day forecast;
            •	Needs to display the current weather;
            
            Here is the basic logic flow (ignoring the high score feature):


                [ ] On load, display the dashboard with the city history contained in local storage;
                [ ] 

                [ ] 

                [ ] 

                [ ] 

                [ ]      


            Build:
            •	Set up three files, index.html, script.js and style.css (add to Github) [x]
            •	HTML:
                >   Try using shoielace to Layout the desired dashboard [ ]
                >   Add current weather bar [ ]
                >   Add Card Components [ ]
                >   Add search bar on the Left side where cities will be displayed [ ]
                

            •	JavaScript: 
                > Set up the get API

            •	CSS:
                >Stylish background image and footer styling [x]
            

            Validation:
            •	TBD


# 03 Testing and Quality Control:

    1. Test each of the criteria to confirm functionality.

    2. Format HTML Code to make it easier to follow when viewed at source.

    3. Load the files and tested the page functionality at GITHUB.

    6. Run the html through a code validation service on the final commit.  Use validator.w3.org and describe any issues and resolution.  Adjust before the final commit. Some duplicate attribute issues, but does not seem to impact results.

# 04 Lessons Learned:

The following items should be considered for future enhancements, time and budget permitting:

    1. How to get an API key.

    2. 


# 05 Further improvements to make:

    1. Have the dashboard emailed to me once a day.

    2.
